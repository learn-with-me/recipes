## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 very large spanish (or yellow) onion
* 30 cloves garlic, 6 minced, 24 sliced into slivers
* 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
* 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
* 2 cups vegetable or garlic broth
* 1/2 cup dry red wine (like a pinot noir)
* 1 tablespoon italian seasoning
* 1 tablespoon oregano
* 1 tablespoon parsley
* 1-2 tablespoon seasoned salt (start with 1, then add more as needed)
* 1.5 teaspoons granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons black pepper
* 1 bunch fresh basil leaves
* 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste

## Process

* Put olive oil in the pot, and hit saute
* Saute onion for about 3 minutes
* Saute garlic for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned
* Put everything in, except tomato paste and basil leaves
* Top with basil leaves but do not stir them in
* Pressure cook on high for 10 minutes
* Quick release when done
* Use potato masher to lightly crush plum tomatoes to desired chunkiness
* Stir in the tomato paste and let stand for 10-20 minutes longer, until slightly thickened.

> Note: It's flavor will really come together once it is refrigerated overnight.

## Storage

Store in the fridge in an airtight container for a week. It can also be frozen for 2-3 months.

## Feedback

This sauce turned out to be amazing. Way better than anything I've bought out from any store. It could be a personal preference, but I am going to continue making this often.

As of now the batch size needs to be consumed within a week, which is too small window for us. Haven't quite figured out extending storage life in refrigerator or the freezing part. Maybe canning is the way to go.
