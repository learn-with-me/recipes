# 🌶️ Salsa Negra

A rich, smoky, and slightly sweet salsa from Veracruz, perfect for drizzling over grilled meats, tacos, or as a dip for tortilla chips.

## Ingredients

- 2 (7½ oz) cans chipotle chiles en adobo (with canning liquid)
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- ¼ cup dark brown sugar (packed)
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar or sweet sherry vinegar
- ½ cup water
- ¼ cup soy sauce

## Instructions

1. **Blend the Ingredients:**
   - Place the chipotle chiles (with canning liquid), molasses, brown sugar, vinegar, and water in a blender.
   - Process until completely smooth.

2. **Cook the Salsa:**
   - Transfer the blended mixture to a small saucepan.
   - Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the salsa thickens to a consistency similar to runny ketchup, about 30 minutes.

3. **Finish the Salsa:**
   - Remove from heat and stir in the soy sauce.
   - Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

4. **Serve:**
   - Let the salsa cool to room temperature before serving.
   - Serve with grilled meats, tacos, or as a dip for tortilla chips.

## Storage

- Store any leftover salsa in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
- Best consumed within **1–2 months**.
- Stir before serving, especially if it has been refrigerated for a few days.

## Notes

- This salsa is highly seasoned to preserve it for longer storage and to enhance its flavor.
- Adjust the amount of soy sauce to taste, depending on your preference for saltiness.
