# 🌶️ Salsa Macha

A rich, nutty, and spicy Mexican chili oil from Veracruz, perfect for drizzling over tacos, grilled meats, or as a dip for tortilla chips.

## Ingredients

- 1½ cups olive oil
- 2 ounces (about ½ cup) peeled garlic cloves
- 2 ounces (about ½ cup) raw peanuts
- 2 ounces dried chiles, stemmed, seeded, and cut into roughly ½-inch pieces (start with guajillo and/or cascabel chiles with a few arbol chiles)
- 2 or 3 tablespoons untoasted sesame seeds
- 2 tablespoons vinegar (balsamic preferred)
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Heat the Oil:**
   - In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium to medium-low heat.

2. **Cook Garlic and Peanuts:**
   - Add the peeled garlic cloves and raw peanuts to the oil.
   - Cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden brown and the peanuts are lightly toasted, about 5–7 minutes.

3. **Add Chiles and Sesame Seeds:**
   - Add the chopped dried chiles and untoasted sesame seeds to the oil.
   - Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the chiles are fragrant and slightly darkened, about 2–3 minutes.

4. **Add Vinegar and Season:**
   - Remove the saucepan from heat.
   - Stir in the vinegar and salt to taste.
   - Let the salsa cool to room temperature.

5. **Store and Serve:**
   - Transfer the salsa to a clean jar or container.
   - Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
   - Serve with tacos, grilled meats, or as a dip for tortilla chips.

## Notes

- For a smoother texture, blend the salsa after it has cooled.
- This salsa is versatile and can be used as a condiment for various dishes.
