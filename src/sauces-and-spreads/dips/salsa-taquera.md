# üå∂Ô∏è Salsa Taquera (Taquer√≠a-Style Red Salsa)

A smoky, flavorful salsa with a rich depth, perfect for pairing with tacos, grilled meats, or as a dip for tortilla chips.

## Ingredients

- 1 large tomato
- 4 medium-sized tomatillos (or 6 small ones)
- 2 garlic cloves, unpeeled
- ‚Öì of a medium white onion
- 15 dried √°rbol chiles
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Roast the Vegetables:**
   - Heat a skillet or heavy griddle over medium heat.
   - Arrange the tomatoes, tomatillos, onion, and garlic on the skillet.
   - Roast the ingredients until they start showing some blistering and look slightly softened, turning them to make sure they roast evenly. The garlic cooks in a few minutes and you will need to remove it, peel the skin, and set aside. The roasting process will take about 8 minutes. If your tomatoes don‚Äôt look softened, wrap them in aluminum foil for about 10 minutes to help them finish cooking.

2. **Toast the Chiles:**
   - Once the vegetables are roasted, add the dried √°rbol chiles to the hot griddle.
   - Slightly roast them, turning them to avoid burning. This step will be very quick, as the chiles' skins burn easily, which gives them an unpleasant bitter taste. Be sure to turn them and roast the peppers without burning them.

3. **Blend the Salsa:**
   - Once all the ingredients (tomatoes, tomatillos, garlic, onion, and roasted chiles) are ready, place them in a blender or food processor.
   - Process until you have a fine texture. If your salsa is too thick, add a little water to reach your desired consistency.
   - Season with salt to taste.

4. **Serve:**
   - Transfer the salsa to a serving bowl.
   - Serve immediately with tacos, grilled meats, or as a dip for tortilla chips.

## Storage

- Store any leftover salsa in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
- Best consumed within **5‚Äì7 days**.
- Stir before serving, especially if it has been refrigerated for a few days.

## Notes

- For a milder salsa, reduce the number of √°rbol chiles or remove the seeds before roasting.
- This salsa pairs well with tacos al pastor, carne asada, or grilled chicken.
- Adjust the amount of salt to taste.
