## Ingredients

* 2 cups basmati rice
* 2 cups water
* Juices of 2 limes, divided equally in two parts
* Zest of 1 lime
* 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* 2 tablespoons ghee or avocado oil
* 1 teaspoon garlic salt

## Process

* Rinse the ride under cold water for 90 seconds and strain, until water becomes from cloudy to clear.
* Add rice, water, juice of 1 lime and cumin seeds to the pot and stir well
* Pressure cook on high for 5 minutes
* Natural release for 10 minutes, followed by a quick release
* Fluff with a fork
* Add remaining lime juice, lime zest, cilantro, ghee/avocado oil, and garlic salt. Stir until combined

> Note: Do not skip rinsing the rice. Unrinsed rice will be mushy, `unless you're making congee`.

> Note: If you can't find basmati rice, use any long-grain rice. Even using brown rice would be fine.
