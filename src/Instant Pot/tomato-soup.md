## Ingredients

* Saute
    * 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
    * 1 bunch scallions, sliced
    * 1 yellow onion, diced
    * 1 large carrot, peeled and sliced into 1/2 inch chunks
    * 2 tablespoons cooking sherry
* Pre-pressure cook
    * 2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes, with their juices
    * 1 cup vegetable broth
    * 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
    * 1 tablespoon dried basil
    * 1.5 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning
    * 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* Post-pressure cook
    * 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
    * 1 cup heavy cream or half-and-half
    * 1 (5.2-ounce) package Boursin spread (any flavor) or 4 ounces cream cheese, cut into chunky cubes
    * 1.5 teaspoons seasoned salt
    * 1 teaspoon black pepper

> Note: You may need more seasoned salt to taste. We did 2-2.5 teaspoons

> Note: The soup came out too thick for our taste. I just added 1 more cup of vegetable broth to adjust the consistency.

## Process

* Pour olive oil, hit saute, and let it heat up
* Saute scallions, onion, and carrot for 10 minutes, until they begin to soften and brown
* Add the cooking sherry and cook for 1 minute longer
* Add `pre-pressure cook` ingredients and stir well
* Pressure cook on high for 5 minutes
* Quick release when done
* Stir in tomato paste and blend until everything is smooth
* Stir in everything else from `post-pressure cook` ingredient list

> Note: Optionally make grilled cheese croutons for serving

## Grilled Cheese Croutons

### Ingredients

* 4 slices sandwich bread of choice (pumpernickel swirl or rye suggested by the author)
* Butter or mayonnaise
* Sliced melty cheese (american suggested by the author)

### Process

* Heat a frying pan over medium heat
* Spread butter or mayo on one side of each slice, and place that side against pan's hot surface
* Top with 2-3 cheese slices, and then the other slice of the bread
* Grill for 3-4 minutes and then flip
* Let it cool for 2 minutes and then slice into 1 inch crouton cubes

## Storage

I wouldn't store it for more than couple of days, because of milk-based ingredients. We got exactly 6 servings out of it.

## Feedback

Simply amazing. We've tried a few different store-bought soups, also made a few at home, but this one turned out to be our most favorite so far.
