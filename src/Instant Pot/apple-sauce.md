## Ingredients

* 10 apples
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 tablespoon pure maple syrup
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 1-2 tablespoon raw honey or agave (optional)

> Note: use 5 Granny smith and 5 Fuji apples, peeled, cored and diced. Or any combination of apples depending on your taste. You can leave the skin on for a darker applesauce.

## Process

* Combine water, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt in the instant pot and mix well
* Add apples and pour the maple syrup and lemon juice over them
* Pressure cook on high for 5 minutes
* Natural release for 5 minutes, followed by a quick release
* Use an immersion blender to puree to desired consistency
* Transfer to the fridge in an air tight container for 4-8 hours

> Note: Do not add more sweetner until you let it cool and taste. You won't find it as sweet when it is hot.

## Storage

Up to 2 weeks in the fridge.

## Feedback

I've personally tried it, and it came out really well.
