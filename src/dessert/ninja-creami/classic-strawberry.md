# Classic Strawberry Ice Cream

`184 calories` for the entire pint!

## Ingredients

* 200ml unsweetened almond milk
* 200ml 2% fat milk
* 15g strawberry cheesecake or vanilla protein powder
* 3g strawberry Jell-O mix
* 80gm strawberries (chopped/blended)
* 1-2gm Xanthan gum or Guar gum
* 15g monk fruit sweetener or zero calorie sweetener

> Note: you've got to add sweetener, since the sweetness decreases once you freeze the ice cream.

## Process

* Mix everything in the jar, shake it and freeze overnight
* Start with `lite ice cream` setting
* Add a tablespoon of water
* Use `Re-spin` setting
