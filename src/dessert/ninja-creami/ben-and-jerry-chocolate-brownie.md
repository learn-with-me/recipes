* 1-2gm Xanthan gum or Guar gum
* 15g monk fruit sweetener or zero calorie sweetener
* 1/2 high protein brownie or Alpha Prime brownie bites

> Note: you've got to add sweetener, since the sweetness decreases once you freeze the ice cream.

* Add a tablespoon of water
* Add the brownie
* Use `Mix-in` setting
* Top with some crumbled brownie
