# Coffee Ice Cream

`150 calories` for the entire pint!

## Ingredients

* 200ml unsweetened almond milk
* 100ml 2% fat milk
* 100ml cold brew coffee
* 15g caramel macchiato protein powder
* 4g fat-free vanilla pudding mix
* 1-2gm Xanthan gum or Guar gum
* 15g brown monk fruit sweetener or zero calorie sweetener
* Optional, Dark chocolate chunks

> Note: you've got to add sweetener, since the sweetness decreases once you freeze the ice cream.

> Note: I would experiment with using instant coffee instead of cold brew. This means using 200ml milk.

## Process

* Mix everything in the jar, shake it and freeze overnight
* Start with `lite ice cream` setting
* Add a tablespoon of water
* If skipping dark chocolate chunks, Use `Re-spin` setting
* If adding dark chocolate chunks, then use `Mix-in` setting
