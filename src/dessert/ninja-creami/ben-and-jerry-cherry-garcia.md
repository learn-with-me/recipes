* 1-2gm Xanthan gum or Guar gum
* 15g monk fruit sweetener or zero calorie sweetener
* 30g maraschino cherries
* 15g chocolate chunks

> Note: you've got to add sweetener, since the sweetness decreases once you freeze the ice cream.

* Start with `lite ice cream` setting
* Add a tablespoon of water
* Add maraschino cherries and chocolate chunks 
* Use `Mix-in` setting
