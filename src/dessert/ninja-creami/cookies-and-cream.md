* 4g fat-free vanilla pudding mix
* 1-2gm Xanthan gum or Guar gum
* 15g monk fruit sweetener or zero calorie sweetener
* 1 Oreo or to taste

> Note: you've got to add sweetener, since the sweetness decreases once you freeze the ice cream.

## Process

* Start with `lite ice cream` setting
* Add a tablespoon of water
* Add oreo(s)
* Use `Mix-in` setting
* Top with little more crushed oreo(s)
