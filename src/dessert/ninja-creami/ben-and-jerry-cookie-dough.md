`296 calories` for the entire pint!

## Ingredients

* 1-2gm Xanthan gum or Guar gum
* 15g monk fruit sweetener or zero calorie sweetener
* Pillsbury edible cookie dough
* 1/4 high protein brownie or Alpha Prime brownie bites

> Note: you've got to add sweetener, since the sweetness decreases once you freeze the ice cream.

## Process

* Start with `lite ice cream` setting
* Add a tablespoon of water
* Add edible cookie dough
* Use `Mix-in` setting
* Top with some brownie, and even some cookie dough
