## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon Ghee or Oil
* 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera)
* 1 Green chili pepper, optional
* 1/2 cup Onions, diced
* 1/2 tablespoon Garlic, minced
* 1/2 tablespoon Ginger , grated
* 1 cup Tomatoes, chopped
* 1 cup Red lentils (Masoor Dal), rinsed
* 3 cups Water, or reduce to 2.5 cup for a thicker dal
* 1 tablespoon Lime juice
* Cilantro , to garnish
* Spices
    * 1/2 teaspoon Ground Turmeric (Haldi powder)
    * 1/2 teaspoon Coriander powder (Dhaniya powder)
    * 1/2 teaspoon Red Chili powder (Mirchi powder), adjust to taste, I used mild Kashmiri red chili powder
    * 1/2 teaspoon Garam Masala , optional
    * 1 teaspoon Salt , adjust to taste
* Rice
    * 1 cup Basmati Rice
    * 1.25 cup Water
    * 1 tablespoon Ghee or Oil
    * 1 teaspoon Salt

## Process

* Start the pressure cooker in sauté mode and let it heat. Add oil and cumin seeds. Sauté for 30 seconds.
* When the cumin seeds change color, add green chili, onions, ginger and garlic. Sauté for 3 minutes until the onions become golden brown while stirring frequently.
* Add tomato and spices. Stir and sauté for another 2 minutes. 
* Add the lentils, water and stir well. 
* (For pot-in-pot rice) Place the trivet. In a bowl, add all ingredients for basmati rice and place it on top of the trivet. Close the lid with vent in sealing position. 
* Press cancel and close lid with vent in sealing position. Change the instant pot setting to manual or pressure cook mode at high pressure for 5 mins. 
* After the instant pot beeps, let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes, then release the pressure manually (5 minute NPR). 
* Open the pot. Add the lime juice and stir the dal. 
* Garnish with cilantro. Serve dal with roti, naan or rice. 

### Process Tadka (Tempering)

* In a small pan, heat ghee or oil. Add some cumin seeds and sliced garlic. Cook for about 30 seconds to a minute until the garlic becomes golden in color. Then take the pan off heat and add a pinch of red chili powder. I prefer Kashmiri red chili powder, as it is not spicy. Drizzle this tempering over the dal when serving. It adds a beautiful pop of color!
