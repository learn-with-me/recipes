## Ingredients

* Extra virgin coconut oil
* Xylitol gum
* Neem leaves

## Process

* Swish the oil around your mouth for 20 minutes, and spit out
* Finish with gargle with water and mineral-rich sea salt
* 20 minutes after each meal, chew a xylitol gum. It helps neutralize acid in our mouth and works on the bacteria to protect enamel through re-mineralization.
* After dinner, infuse 8-9 neem leaves in really hot water, and drink it
* Brush teeth before bed

> Note: oil pull, pulls the bacteria out of the mouth, moisturizes the gum, and whitens teeth

> Note: Neem tea is going to be a bit bitter
