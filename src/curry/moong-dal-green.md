## Ingredients

* 1 cup Green Gram Lentils (Green Moong Dal), whole, rinsed (1 cup = 250 ml)
* 1 tablespoon Ghee
* 1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera)
* 1 Green Chili Pepper, chopped (optional)
* 1/2 tablespoon Ginger, grated or paste
* 1/2 tablespoon Garlic, minced or paste
* 1 cup Onion, diced
* 1 cup Tomato, chopped
* 3 cup Water
* 1 tablespoon Lime juice
* Cilantro, to garnish
* Spices
    * 1/4 teaspoon Ground Turmeric (Haldi powder)
    * 1 teaspoon Coriander powder (Dhaniya powder)
    * 1/2 teaspoon Red Chili powder (Mirchi powder), I used Kashmiri red chili powder
    * 1/2 teaspoon Garam Masala
    * 1 teaspoon Salt

## Process

* Start the instant pot in SAUTE mode and heat oil in it. Add cumin seeds, green chili and saute for 30 seconds.
* Add onions, ginger and garlic. Saute for 3 minutes. 
* Add chopped tomato, spices and stir. 
* Add lentils and water. Stir well. Press CANCEL and close the instant pot lid with vent in sealing position.
* Pressure Cook for 15 minutes. When the instant pot beeps, let the pressure release naturally (NPR).
* Open the lid and add lime juice and cilantro. Stir and green moong dal is ready to be served. 

> Note: If you soak for 3-4 hours, reduce cooking time to 12 minutes.

> Note: Yet to play around with ratio of water. This recipe says 1:3. I started with 1:4. If not soaked 1:8 is also ok.
