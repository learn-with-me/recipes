# Introduction

Welcome to my culinary journey! Over the years, I've stumbled upon some truly amazing recipes that have left a lasting impression on my taste buds. However, like many of us, I tend to forget them unless I practice regularly. This has led to some regret over not being able to recall those delightful dishes. Plus, with the ever-evolving world of cooking, new methods and techniques are constantly emerging.

To preserve these culinary treasures and adapt to modern cooking trends, I decided to document my favorite recipes, cooking basics, methods, and tricksâ€”all tailored to my personal taste. This notebook is my way of sharing my passion for cooking with you, and I hope it inspires you to create delicious meals in your own kitchen.
