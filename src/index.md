# Introduction

Over my lifetime, I've come across some amazing recipes. Unfrotunately, the way my brain works, unless I am actively practicing something, I'll forget it. And because of this, I have some deep regret about not being able to remember those recipes. Also, with changing times, some methods have evolved.

I started writing these notes to document cooking basics, recipes, methods, and tricks, tailored to my personal taste.
