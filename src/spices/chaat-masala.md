## About

* Whole Coriander Seeds - Lends a citrusy and nutty flavor to chaat masala.
* Fennel Seeds - Adds a sweet, licorice-like taste. You won't be able to put a finger on fennel, however trust me it's an essential.
* Cumin Seeds - Provides a warm, earthy taste. If you have roasted cumin powder at hand, you can skip toasting the whole seeds and use that instead.
* Black Peppercorns - Bring in a spicy, peppery kick.
* Red Chili Powder - If you want an authentic tasting chaat masala, stick to using hot chili powder (or cayenne pepper powder). We won't use a ton but enough to contribute to a mildly fiery kick that remains on the tastebuds for a while.
* Dry Mango Powder (Amchur) - Amchur is made by grinding dried pieces of unripe mangoes. It is a key ingredient and adds a tangy flavor.
* Black Salt (Kala Namak) - Gives a unique sulfurous taste and saltiness. A must if you ask me. You could buy it in indian grocery stores or online on amazon. Though it looks pinkish in color, it is totally different in taste and texture from himalayan pink salt.

## Storage

Transfer the chaat masala spice powder to an airtight container. Store it in a cool, dry place. It should last for several months.
