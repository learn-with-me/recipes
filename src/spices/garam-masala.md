# Garam masala

Warm spices like cinnamon, cloves, black pepper provide warmth to the body and hence are highly recommended for consumption during the winter months.

On the other hand, spices like fennel, coriander, or cumin have a cooling effect on the body.

The dominant flavor notes in garam masala come from the warm spices, while the cooling spices are used in smaller quantities to create a harmonious and balanced tasting spice blend.

## Process

* Roughly break spices like whole red chilli, bay leaves, cinnamon stick into smaller pieces.
* Start spices in a cold pan. Place the pan on the stove on a low flame. Stirring constantly, lightly roast the spices for 5-7 minutes only. Roasting awakens the oils in the spices thereby enhancing their aroma and potency.
* Allow it to cool down
* Grind to a fine powder in intervals of 30-40 seconds.

> Note: Roasting a lot will take away the aroma of the garam masala and taste wise, it may become bitter.

## About

* Coriander Seeds (Sabut Dhania/dhaniya) - These are seeds of the coriander (cilantro) plant and are used in various dishes, both in ground and whole form imparting a mild & citrus flavor. It is not a common spice to use in garam masala however it balances the sharp flavors of other spices.
* Cumin Seeds (Jeera/Zeera) Cumin seeds are a digestive aid and they add an earthy aroma to garam masala.
* Fennel Seeds (Saunf/Lucknow Saunf) These pale green oval shape seeds have a sweet, licorice taste that lends an earthy taste to garam masala.
* Mace (Javitri) Mace is the outer protective covering of nutmeg seed. The flavor of mace is sharper as compared to nutmeg though still sweet and aromatic. A little mace goes a long way.
* Cinnamon (Dalchini)- Use true cinnamon(ceylon cinnamon).
* Bay Leaves (Tej Patta)- Indian bay leaf come from the cassia tree and have a hint of cinnamon, you could substitute with regular bay leaf (has a pine aroma).
* Black Peppercorn (Kali Mirch/Gol Mirch )- Black peppercon is also called the black gold of India. It was of the most prominent spice that was traded along the silk route (spice route).
* Kashmiri Red Chillies( Sabut Mirch/Sukhi Mirch)-De seed the red chillies before using. These add a mild kick to the garam masala.
* Cloves (Laung )-Cloves have a pungent warm flavor and a strong aroma. This spice has a noticeable amount of heat and adds a zing to garam masala powder.
* Black Cardamom (Badi Elaichi/Moti Eliachi)-Black cardamon is used a lot in north indian dishes especially the meat dishes. It has a strong woody & smoky aroma which is totally different from that of green cardamom. If you don't have it in your pantry, you could skip it.
* Green Cardamom (Hari Elaichi/Choti Elaichi)- Cardamom has a balmy sweet aroma and lemony flavor. It adds a sweet note to the fragrance of garam masala. We will use the full pods.
* Nutmeg (Jaiphal )- Nutmeg has a very delicate yet strong taste and aroma and it adds a wonderful warmth to garam masala.
