# ðŸŒ½ Mexican Street Corn (Elotes)

A flavorful and spicy take on a classic street food favorite, perfect for summer gatherings or as a side dish.

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons lime juice (from about 2 limes), plus extra for seasoning
- 3 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
- Table salt, to taste
- 2â€“3 jalapeÃ±o peppers, chopped
- 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, divided
- 6 ears of corn, kernels cut from cobs (approximately 6 cups)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 4 ounces cotija or goat cheese, crumbled (about 1 cup)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dressing:** In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, sour cream, mayonnaise, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.

5. **Combine Ingredients:** Remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the prepared dressing, crumbled cheese, chopped cilantro, and sliced scallions. Mix until well combined.
