## Ingredients

* 1 cup neutral oil
* 1 egg
* 1 tablespoon lemon or lime juice or wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard or Dijon mustard (optional)

## Process

* Blend your mixture really well (about 2-3 minutes). Works best with a immersion blender.

> Note: Acid helps to stabilize the mixture.

> Note: Mustard adds a bit of flavor, but it also helps to keep the mayonnaise stable. Along with the egg yolk, mustard helps emulsify the mixture, reducing the risk of our mayo breaking.

> Note: play around with spices to add flavor. For example, adding 4-5 roasted garlic cloves adds flavor similar to garlic aioli.

> Note: Fixing Broken Mayonnaise: Transfer your broken mayo to a measuring jug, and clean the food processor bowl and blade. Add an egg yolk and 1/2 teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice to the clean food processor bowl.

### Seasonings

Options:

1. Black pepper, onion powder, dry dill
2. 4-5 Roasted garlic cloves, fresh chives and parsley, rosemary infused oil

### Kewpie Mayo

This Japanese mayo uses only the egg yolks instead of whole eggs. Dijon mustard is required. A good sprinkle of MSG and a teaspoon of sugar.

## Storage

Refrigerate in an air-tight jar for up to 1 week

## Feedback

Came out really well. We don't buy mayo anymore from store.
