**FEEDBACK:**

> Loved it. Basic and flavorful recipe. Has to go with a base like rice or pasta.

**INGREDIENTS:**

```
4 Chicken Breasts
1/4 Cup of Butter
1 Italian Dressing Seasoning Dry Mix
1 Can Cream of Chicken Soup
1 (8 Oz) Pkg Cream Cheese

Additional, to taste
Add in Montreal Chicken seasoning, lemon pepper or other favorites as it is cooking in the slow cooker.
```

**DIRECTIONS:**

```
In a crock pot, mix together the soup, butter and italian seasoning packet.
Add the chicken breasts.
Cook in crockpot on low for 5-6 hours or high 3 – 3 1/2 hours.
Shred chicken and add cream cheese to the sauce.
Mix until smooth. If it seems too thick add a little milk.
Serve over rice or pasta!
```

**STORAGE:**

```
Normally you don’t want to freeze anything that has a lot of cream or cream cheese in it as it can curdle
when reheating or separate. This crockpot chicken and rice recipe is a different story as that can of
soup really helps to keep things together.
