# Sandwich & Burgers

##### Sandwich Basics

* Choose a proper bread
  As a general rule, the moister the filling, the drier and dense the bread should be. Can swap in large tortillas for moist fillings.

* Ingredients
* Fresh toppings
  These lend moisture, crunch and freshness. And provide a wonderful foil for heavy, rich ingredients.  
  Lettuce and Tomato are defaults. Try roasted peppers in place of tomato; And spinach, shredded cabbage or cucumber in place of lettuce. Replacements also avoid the mushiness over time that comes with lettuce and tomato.

* Nice spread
  Adds flavor but also performs essential task of lending moisture and/or creaminess to sandwiches  
  Mustard, Mayo, Vinaigrettes, Pesto, BBQ sauces, chutneys, salsa

* Stave off sogginess  
  Spread mayo, butter or cream cheese all the way to the edges of each slice of bread to create a seal against wet sandwich fillings

* Take the edge off onions  
  To enjoy them raw even better, you can soak thinly sliced onions in ice water for 20 mins and then blot dry to add crispness. Or toss slice onions with a generous sprinkled kosher salt, wait a few mins, rub salt into the onions, rinse and drain.
