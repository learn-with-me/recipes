# Smoothies

You can have million combinations that won't taste bad as a smoothie while keeping it healthy.

Here are some basics to keep in mind:

* I personally own a Vitamix. It is an expensive machine, so if you are under budget, try atleast going with a 1000+ watt machine. Nutri-bullet is a very good alternative.
* Usually I freeze my fruits and vegetables for two reasons:
  * No need to use ice in smoothie. Frozen ingredients are usually good enough.
  * Prolonged life
* To add sweetness, you can use over-ripe fruits. Other alternative can be using Agave syrup or Honey
* For low-fat/low-calorie smoothie, use water as your base
* If your smoothie is too sweet, add a pinch of sea salt

#### General Composition
