## Ingredients

* Chicken breasts
* 1 pack of taco seasoning mix
* 1 can red enchilada sauce
* Optional Ingredients
* Optional Toppings
    * Blended cottage cheese

## Process

* Add chicken in crockpot and rub spices on both sides
* Add rest of the ingredients and set on high for 6 hours
* Once done, shred chicken with 2 forks and mix it back in the pot
* Serve it over pasta, rice, tacos or even nachos!

> Note: I may have texture preferences. Some people recommend using hand blender to shred chicken. I didn't like it, so I prefer using forks. It doesn't take long.
