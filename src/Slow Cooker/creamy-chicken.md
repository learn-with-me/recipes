## Ingredients

* Chicken breasts
* 1 can cream of chicken soup
* 1 block (8 oz) cream cheese
* 1/2 bottle garlic parmesan marinade (from Sweet Baby Ray)
* 1 garlic powder
* 1 onion powder
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Optional Ingredients
    * Any all purpose seasoning
    * 2 finely chopped jalapenos
    * Baby potatoes (skin on, if you don't mind)
* Optional Toppings
    * Chopped bacon
    * Sun-dried tomatoes
    * Baby spinach
    * Shredded mozzarella to taste
    * Shredded parmesan to taste
    * Green onion
* Substitutes
    * Some people like using ranch seasoning mix instead of garlic parmesan marinade
    * Can replace green onion with fresh chives
    * Some people use broth instead of cream of chicken

> Note: Use low calorie versions of cream of chicken and cream cheese, if you're counting calories

## Process

* Add chicken in crockpot and rub spices on both sides
* Add rest of the ingredients and set on low for 8 hours
* Once done, shred chicken with 2 forks and mix it back in the pot
* Eat as is or serve it over pasta!
* Additionally, you can add hot sauce and/or green onion while serving.

> Note: I may have texture preferences. Some people recommend using hand blender to shred chicken. I didn't like it, so I prefer using forks. It doesn't take long.

> Note: If you add toppings, let it sit for another 15 minutes for all flavors to mix in.

> Note: Cooking it on high for 4 hours works the same.

## Storage

TBD

## Feedback

I've tried it without optional ingredients and toppings. It was mildly flavored for my taste but I liked it so far. Going to play around with these toppings to tune to my taste.
