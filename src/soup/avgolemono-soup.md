## Ingredients

* 6 cups chicken broth
* 1 cup uncooked orzo
* 3 large eggs
* Juice of 2 lemons
* Crumbled feta cheese, for topping (optional)
* Shredded chicken, for topping (optional)

> Note: Use real lemons. The fresher taste is totally worth it.

## Process

* Place chicken broth and orzo in the pot
* Pressure cook on high for 5 minutes
* Meanwhile, combine eggs and lemon juice in a bowl until totally combined
* Quick release when done
* Hit saute on `low` setting
* Take a cup of cooked broth and slowly pour into the lemon-egg mixture and stil until totally combined
* Slowly pour lemon-egg-broth mixture in the pot and stir for good 3 minutes, until the mixture looks creamy.
* Top off with crumbled feta cheese, if desired
* Also top off with a thin slice of lemon, if desired
* Toss in some shredded rotisserie chicken right before serving, if desired

> Note: Trust the process. It may look too watery, but the soup becomes thicker over time.

## Storage

TBD

## Feedback

This one came out to be ok. Not bad, and not too good either that I am excited about. I'll have to play around the recipe to adjust to my taste a bit. More updates to come soon.
