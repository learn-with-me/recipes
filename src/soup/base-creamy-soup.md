## Ingredients

* Base (Velouté sauce)
    * 2 tablespoons butter (unsalted)
    * 1 small onion (diced)
    * 1/3 cup sifted all-purpose flour
    * 4 cups broth (preferably chicken)
* 2 lbs of raw vegetable (spinach)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Topping (optional)
  * Heavy cream
  * Croutons

> Note: cream soups were classically made from `Béchamel sauce`, which is made with of milk, and thickened with a Roux. `Velouté sauce` is a lighter version of this base, but with greater dimension of flavor.

> Note: Vegetables can be spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, cauliflower, asparagus, corn, or anything else

## Process

* Base - Velouté sauce (making a Roux)
  * Sweat onions in butter
  * Add flour and mix well. Cook the flour a little bit for butty flavor
  * Start adding broth gradually, whisking, to avoid any clumps
  * Bring it to boil and reduce it down to simmer for 10 minutes, so it gets nice and thick.
* Vegetables
  * Saute/steam/blanch vegetables
  * Remove excess moisture so the soup isn't too runny/light
* Final steps
  * Blend base with the vegetables
  * Season the soup with salt and pepper
  * Optional add heavy cream
  * Turn the heat up but there's no need to boil

> Note: any starch needs to be boiled in order to reach it's thickening potential
