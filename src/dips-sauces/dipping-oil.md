* 1 teaspoon italian seasoning or oregano
* 1 tablespoon fresh parsley
* 1/4 cup finely grated parmesan
* 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil

## Process

* Combine everything together and enjoy with a bread

## Storage

Oil doesn't go bad. Store it in an airtight container and shake well before use.

Because of other fresh ingredients, I wouldn't keep it more than a few weeks.
