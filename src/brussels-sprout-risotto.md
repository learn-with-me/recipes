## Ingredients

* 1 pound brussels sprouts, coarsely shredded or chopped
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 1 tablespoon ghee
* 2 shallots, diced

* 4.5 cups garlic broth or low-sodium vegetable broth
* 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

> Note: Arborio rice or similar is very important to make a proper risotto.

## Process

* Brussels Sprouts
    * Shred coarsely in a food processor
    * Broil in the oven at 400C for 10-15 minutes
    * Alternatively, crisp it in a pan
    * Save some for topping when serving
* Add ghee, hit saute and wait for 3 minutes
* Saute shallots for 2 minutes
* Saute garlic for 1 minute
* Add rice, stir well, cook for 1 minute
* Add broth and stir
* Pressure cook on high for 6 minutes
* Quick release when done
* Add seasoned salt, black pepper, italian seasoning and stir
* Add crispy brussels sprouts and stir
* Add parmesan cheese and stir until it's combined and creamy
* Serve topped with some crispy brussels sprouts

> Note: Alternatively replace brussels sprouts with half a head of cabbage

> Note: Salt levels can be a bit tricky from person to person. Play around with seasonings and salt to tune to your taste.

> Note: Adding (not substituting) shredded broccoli also worked for me.
