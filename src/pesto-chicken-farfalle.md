## Ingredients

* 1 pound farfalle (bowtie pasta)
* 2.5 cups low-sodium chicken or garlic broth
* 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken brest, cut into bite-size pieces
* 10 ounce frozen peas (optional)
* fresh basil, chopped (optional)
* Pesto (store-bought or make your own [here](./pesto.md))

## Process

* Add pasta and broth to the pot
* Top with chicken. No need to stir, as we want pasta submerged.
* Pressure cook on high for 6 minutes
* Quick release when done
* Add pesto and frozen peas, and mix well together.

> Note: Heat of the pasta will thaw the peas.
