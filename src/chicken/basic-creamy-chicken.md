## Ingredients

* 4 Chicken Breasts
* 1/4 Cup of Butter
* 1 Italian Dressing Seasoning Dry Mix
* 1 Can Cream of Chicken Soup
* 1 (8 Oz) Pkg Cream Cheese
* Additional, to taste
    * Add in Montreal Chicken seasoning, lemon pepper or other favorites as it is cooking in the slow cooker.

### Italian Dressing Seasoning Dry Mix

* 1 tablespoon garlic salt
* 1 tablespoon onion powder
* 1 tablespoon white sugar
* 2 tablespoons dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1 tablespoon dried parsley
* 1/4 teaspoon celery salt
* 2 tablespoons salt

## Process

* In a crock pot, mix together the soup, butter and italian seasoning packet.
* Add the chicken breasts.
* Cook in crockpot on low for 5-6 hours or high 3-3.5 hours.
* Shred chicken and add cream cheese to the sauce.
* Mix until smooth. If it seems too thick add a little milk.
* Serve over rice or pasta!

## Storage

Normally you donâ€™t want to freeze anything that has a lot of cream or cream cheese in it as it can curdle when reheating or separate. This crockpot chicken and rice recipe is a different story as that can of
soup really helps to keep things together.

## Feedback

> Loved it. Basic and flavorful recipe. Has to go with a base like rice or pasta.
