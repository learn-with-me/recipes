## Ingredients

* 4 Chicken breasts/thighs
* 1 jar (8.5 oz) sun-dried tomatoes with italian herbs and oil, julienne cut or cut them yourself
* 1 can (8.5 oz) drained quartered artichokes hearts
* 6 oz baby spinach
* 1 tsp Garlic powder, or to taste
* 1 tsp Onion powder, or to taste
* 1/2 tsp dried basil
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano
* Ground black pepper to taste
* Optional Ingredients
    * 1 tsp Slap Ya Mama seasoning
* Optional Toppings

> Note: I like bone in chicken for this recipe, since the bones comes off easily once cooked, and the flavor is better as well.

## Process

* Rub all spices on the chicken and place it in the bottom of the crockpot.
* Add sun-dried tomatoes with oil and artichokes in the crockpot and set on low for 6 hours.
* Add spinach in last 10 minutes

> Note: optionally serve with a alfredo pasta

## Storage

TBD

## Feedback

I've made this one several times, and have loved it. Any seasoning with salt definitely boosts the overall flavor.
