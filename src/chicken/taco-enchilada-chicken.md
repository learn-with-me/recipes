## Ingredients

* 4 Chicken breasts
* 1 pack of taco seasoning mix (use Ortega or any other brand)
* 1 10oz can red enchilada sauce
* Optional Ingredients
* Optional Toppings
    * Blended cottage cheese

> Note: use liquid wisely if you're looking for drier consistency. I used 19 oz can, and couldn't make my burritos, while the taste was still good. I wouldn't replace enchilada sauce with anything, for now.

## Process

* Add chicken in crockpot and rub spices on both sides
* Add rest of the ingredients and set on high for 6 hours
* Once done, shred chicken with 2 forks and mix it back in the pot
* Serve it over pasta, rice, tacos or even nachos!

> Note: I may have texture preferences. Some people recommend using hand blender to shred chicken. I didn't like it, so I prefer using forks. It doesn't take long.

## Storage

TBD

## Feedback

It's ok so far. I like it, but it needs something more that I need to figure out. Based on consistency, it will work well for tacos, and may be nachos. A little runny though. Will try reducing the amount of sauce used.
