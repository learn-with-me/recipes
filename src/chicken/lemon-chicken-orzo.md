    * 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

> Note: This is a one-pot recipe. It is important to stir orzo occasionally or it'll stick to the bottom of the pan.

## Feedback

Made this recipe once, following exact steps. Really good comfort food. Definitely one to make once in a while. Instead of adding more flavor to the recipe, I used sauces for variations.

I used chicken thighs while original recipe is with chicken breasts. I also doubled the amount of chicken recommended to make it protein-heavy recipe.
