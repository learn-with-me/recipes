# Chia pudding

This is basically chia seeds soaked in milk, with added toppings, very similar to overnight oats.

## Base recipe

### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 tablespoon chia seeds
* 1.5 teaspoon maple syrup

> Note: This is 1 serving

### Process

* Mix everything together. Always let it sit for 5 minutes after mixing, then mix again to remove clumps. This step is important for smooth and creamy consistency.
* Put it in the fridge overnight, or at least 2-3 hours.
* Serve either cold or heat it up in microwave

> Note: the pudding stays fresh up to 5 days in the fridge, or freeze for a few weeks.

> Note: optionally add frozen fruits before refrigerating, to thaw at the same time.

### Topping ideas

* Fresh fruits
* Granola, nuts, seeds
* Nut butter
* Apple sauce
* Coconut, chocolate
* Cinnamon, spices
