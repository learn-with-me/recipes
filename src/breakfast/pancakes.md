## Ingredients

* Dry ingredients
    * 1 1/3 cups all-purpose (160g) flour
    * 1 teaspoon kosher salt (3/4 tsp for iodized salt, being harsher)
    * 2 tablespoons sugar, to soften the batter
    * 1 tablespoon baking powder
* Wet ingredients
    * 1 cup buttermilk or whole milk (240ml room temperature)
    * 1 large egg (room temperature)
    * 4 tablespoons melted (56g) butter (or vegetable oil)
    * 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* Mix-ins
    * chocolate or berries or anything else

## Process

* Mix the dry ingredients
* Whisk the wet ingredients
* Mix both mixtures well together
* Butter the pan, and start going on a medium-low heat with about 1/3rd of the cup for each pancake.
* Once cooked, cool off on a wire-rack
* Serve with maple syrup or honey. Optionally add butter.

> Note: do not hold back on butter in the pan, since that is what gives pancake it's crispy brown color and rich flavor. 

> Note: when making a bigger pancake, lower the heat. You don't want burnt outside while inside a bit undercooked.

> Note: can do half butter and half oil, for the taste of butter and crispness that oil gives.

> Note: Add mix-ins while combining all ingredients or while making each pancake directly. Either works well.

> Note: It helps to have a wire-rack handy, which allows all the steam to go away and keep the waffles crisp.

## Storage

> Note: To store leftovers, wait for the pancakes to reach room temperature before transferring them to a zip-top bag or airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. If you put them away while still warm, condensation will form, and the pancakes will become soggy.

Pancakes freeze wonderfully! Wrap pancakes tightly in plastic wrap, then place them in a freezer-safe bag or container. They will keep in the freezer for up to three months.
