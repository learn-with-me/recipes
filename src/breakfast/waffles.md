Makes 10 waffles

## Ingredients

* Dry ingredients
    * 2 1/4 cups all-purpose (270g) flour
    * 1/4 cup (50g) sugar
    * 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (1/2 tsp for iodized salt, being harsher)
    * 1 tablespoon baking powder
* Wet ingredients
    * 2 cups milk (room temperature)
    * 2 large eggs (room temperature)
    * 1/2 cup melted butter (or vegetable oil)
    * 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* Mix-ins
    * chocolate or berries or anything else

## Process

* Mix the dry ingredients
* Whisk the wet ingredients
* Mix both mixtures well together
* Put it in the waffle maker
* Once cooked, cool off on a wire-rack
* Serve with maple syrup or honey. Optionally add butter.

> Note: can do half butter and half oil, for the taste of butter and crispness that oil gives.

> Note: Add mix-ins while combining all ingredients or while making each waffle directly. Either works well.

> Note: It helps to have a wire-rack handy, which allows all the steam to go away and keep the waffles crisp.

### Belgian waffles

> Note: This was a recipe for original american waffles. Belgian waffles are puffier/fluffier with additional toppings on it.

The difference is between yeast dough vs batter that has fluffed egg-whites folded in.

* They do use an extra teaspoon of baking powder.
* 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar to make them cakey instead of bready
* Egg-whites are fluffed, while egg yolks mixed with wet ingredients

## Storage

> Note: You can refrigerate any leftovers for up to 5 days. Freeze any extra waffles for up to 2 months. Toast them anytime you have a craving for one.
