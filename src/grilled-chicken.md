## Ingredients

* Chicken (thighs or breasts) - I use skinless and boneless but anything is fine
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons onion powder
* 2 teaspoons italian seasoning
* 1 teaspoon cumin or paprika
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

> Note:
> 1. Play with the quantity of spices to your taste. This one just works best for my palette.
> 2. Also get a feel of how much spices you like on your chicken. I eyeball it and hence no chicken weight mentioned in the recipe
> 3. I store prepared spice mix ahead of time so I can use desired quantity when needed.

## Process

* Preparing chicken
    * Take chicken out of the fridge 20 minutes before working on it
    * Trim excess fat and skin
    * Wash and pat dry
* Mix all spices in a bowl
* Add olive oil and make a paste
* Apply paste to chicken and let it sit for a few hours for best flavor. Can cook right away if in a rush
* Cook on medium heat in a Cast Iron or on a Grill for 4 minutes on each side. Alternatively bake in the oven, preheated at 425F for 20 minutes. 

> Note: Once done, let it sit in a plate for 10 minutes for all juices to settle, before eating for better flavors.

> Note: For extra, serve a siding of mashed potatoes, roasted brussles sprouts, or kale salad.

## Storage

I do fine preparing larger batches for the week and storing in air tight container in the fridge

## Feedback

This is one of the most popular chicken recipes that my friends and family have liked.
