## Ingredients

* 1 pound lean ground beef
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 small white onion, chopped
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 1 cup beef broth
* ½ teaspoon cumin
* ¼ teaspoon garlic salt
* pepper, to taste
* optional - shredded cheddar cheese
* optional - chopped red onions

> Note: Hot dog chili tends to be slightly sweeter than regular chili that you’d eat from a bowl. Also, it’s usually made with ketchup.

## Process

* In a large saucepan, brown the garlic and onion. Cook until fragrant and light brown.
* Add the ground beef and cook until there's no more pink in the meat.
* Once the meat is just cooked, add in the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, cumin, garlic salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
* Let the chili simmer on medium-low and reduce for 15 minutes.
* Serve the chili on top of hot dogs and garnish with shredded cheddar cheese and chopped red onions.
