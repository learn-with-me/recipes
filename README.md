## How to use the template

### Creating a repo

Click on `Use this template` green button from the [repository](https://github.com/learn-with-me/mkdocs-template) to create your own repository in a desired github account.

### Updating configuration

Now, update the following fields in `mkdocs.yml` file

- `repo_url` - path to your new repo
- `site_url` - path where GitHub will deploy your new site, or your domain if you have one
- `homepage` - path where GitHub will deploy your new site, or your domain if you have one
- `property` - if you need analytics, you can replace the google analytics tag for your repo with your own. Otherwise remove the `analytics` section completely

### Files Cleanup

- `docs` folder is meant to provide some guidelines for contributing to the project. It is unrelated to newer projects, however feel free to use it if needed.
- `help` folder is meant to help you understand how to best use the template, and provide help if you feel stuck somewhere. If you don't need it, feel free to get rid of it, since you can always refer back to the original template.
- Update `README.md` file with your own content, based on what you intend to document

### Optional changes

1. You can update your new site's icon by replacing the image `logo.png` from `/src/assets/images`. As of now, we only use `logo.png`, feel free to get rid of other files.
2. Add your website's url on your github repository for easy access
3. Add tags on your github repository if interested

### Deploy the website

Nothing needs to be done here. Your GitHub workflow will take care of pushing the changes out to gh-pages automatically once you commit your new changes

## Help

There is good documentation [here](./help/local-development.md) for tasks that may be helpful. Feel free to check it out.
